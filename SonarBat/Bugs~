Alpha 1.0 resolved a bug that caused the program to crash
          when a key was pressed beyond the valid range
          of the array.

Resolution: Set an if statement to check that left, up,
            down, right, a, b, start and select are the
            only keys allowed.

Alpha 1.0 Unresolved bug: keys may be too sensitive.
